# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
  scr/App.js

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### In This Code  
  1) Hooks --> useState
      ● React Hooks provide functional components with the ability to use states and manage side effects. They         were first introduced in React 16.8, and allow developers to hook into the state and other React               features without having to write a class. They provide a cleaner and more concise way to handle state          and side effects in React applications.  
  2) import axios library
      ● Axios, which is a popular library is mainly used to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints.         This library is very useful to perform CRUD operations.
  3) api --> https://api.github.com/users/
      ● This Api Only Not Display Followers Following Repos, but this aip display which language use large code
        how many Star have in this Repos, how many Branch in this code, when last time push this Repos. All            This Work can perform in this code.
      ● I'm Only use how many Followers Following Repos, i'm not use star / branch / last time push extra
        content.
      ● You can Add This Extra Content I am upload this content code in few day.
